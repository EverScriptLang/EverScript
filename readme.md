# Contributions

You are free to open issues or pull requests. I'm not the best at Java, so I would highly appreciate it if you could suggest some places where the codebase could be improved.

Also, I am open to people that would like to be active contributors for EverScript. The development team is currently just me, and a friend that refactors code and helps out with the documentation (still to come).
